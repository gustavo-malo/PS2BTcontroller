# PS2BTcontroller

3D Modelling can often be cumbersome for even the most experienced designers, and while I myself am not very good at CAD, I sympathize with their struggles. The end goal for this project is to turn a PS2 controller into an interface with which to use 3D design software, and hopefully turn it into a more user-friendly experience.

This is my first project where I actually *try* to document everything I do, as well as trying to make everything from scratch. This probably means it wont be very good so im sure no one will actually see this, but im glad to leave this for posterity.
